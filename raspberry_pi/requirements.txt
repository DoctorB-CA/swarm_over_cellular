# Raspberry Pi Drone Relay Requirements
# These packages are needed for the drone relay system

# No Python packages required - uses only standard library
# The relay system is designed to work with Python 3.7+ standard library only

# System dependencies (installed by setup_relay.sh):
# - ffmpeg (for video relay)
# - python3 (Python 3.7+)
# - systemd (for service management)
# - iptables (for firewall rules)
# - hostapd (for WiFi hotspot)
# - dnsmasq (for DHCP server)

# Optional monitoring tools:
# - htop (process monitoring)
# - iotop (I/O monitoring)  
# - iftop (network monitoring)
# - nethogs (network usage by process)
# - tcpdump (packet capture)
# - vnstat (network statistics)

# For development/testing, you might want:
# - numpy (for advanced data processing)
# - opencv-python (for video analysis)
# - PyQt5 (if running GUI tools on Pi)

# But the core relay only needs Python standard library
